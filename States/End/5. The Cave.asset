  storyText: "You walk over to the cave, cautious. It's dark and you don't have any
    sort of light source. You walk into the entrance, your eyes start adjusting to
    the darkness. You see a faint light at the other end.\r\n\r\nSlowly, you walk
    towards it, feeling your way through the dim light. When you emerge on the other
    side, you're bathed in a warm light. \r\n\r\nSomething unnatural catches your
    eye. You rub your eyes, looking on in disbelief, you see buildings. \rYou're at
    the resort! This whole time, you were on the same island as the resort. You walk
    towards it, hopeful and head held high. Too bad the jet crashed and everyone else
    died. At least you survived and are now able to give your speech and become more
    famous than Bear Grylls.\r\n\nPress 1 to survive...\n"
