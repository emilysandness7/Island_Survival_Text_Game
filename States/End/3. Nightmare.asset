  storyText: "You wake up with a jolt. You look around you wildly. You see... seats,
    a safety booklet in your lap. A flight attendant giving you a weird look but quickly
    turning it into a smile.\r\n\r\nYou're back on the jet. It was just a nightmare...
    You take a deep breath, relax and go back to your reading. \r\n\r\nThe crackle
    of the comm system interrupts your reading. \r\n\r\n\"All passengers, please be
    seated and buckle your seatbelts. We are experiencing a little turbulence. Please
    remain in your seat until the turbulence passes. Thank you.\"\r\n\r\nYou feel
    the jet start to shake and bump, you start crying...\n\nPress 1 to accept your
    death...\r\n"
