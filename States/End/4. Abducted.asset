  storyText: "You hear an unearthly sound. It's like a jet but, different. You look
    up. A strange ship is hovering over you. You try to run but you're frozen, you
    can't move a muscle. \r\n\r\nThe ship above emits a beam of light, you find yourself
    surrounded by this beam. You start to panic, you try to move desperately but nothng
    is working. The aliens just watch you, their reptilian faces emotionless.\r\n\r\nYou're
    lifted off of the ground and you start floating upwards. Up towards the ship.
    Everything inside of you is screaming.\r\n\r\nYou enter the ship and you never
    return.\r\n\nPress 1 to accept your death..."
