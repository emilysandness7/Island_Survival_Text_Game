  storyText: "\rWater floods in, the jet makes awful noises and starts to collapse
    in on itself. You pull the string to inflate the raft and you shoot out of the
    emergency hatch.\r\n\r\nThe pressure of the water crushes you. All of the air
    is forced out of your lungs. You blindly try to breathe in but the pressure won't
    allow it. Your vision grows dark and and black fog rolls over your mind.\r\n\r\nWithin
    a couple of minutes, the raft breaks the surface of the stormy waters. You surface
    as well only... you don't gasp fro air. Your body floats, still tied to the raft.
    You are dead, crushed by the pressure of the water. \r\n\nPress 1 to accept your
    death..."
