  storyText: "You're breathing heavily, sweating, panicking. You're at the bottom
    of the ocean. There's only a slim chance of making it out alive. \r\n\nEven though
    your chances of survival are slim, you have to try. You're not going to give up.
    You look for the emergency inflatable boat. You hear the jet's hull starting to
    cave and crumble under the pressure of the water. \r\n\r\nAt last you find it,
    you prepare yourself to open the emergency hatch. You tie the raft to yourself
    in case you pass out. A deep breath, and you open the hatch.\n\nPress 1 to continue...\r\n\n"
