  storyText: "You wake up with a jolt. You feel wet and light headed, everything is
    dim. You see water pooling around you and you can hear water comng into the jet.
    \r\n\r\nYou grab your backpack next to you and look out the windows. It's black,
    pitch black. You feel the panic wanting to explode inside you. \r\n\r\nThe jet
    is submerged. That's why it's dark out. That's why it's wet and you can hear water
    coming in. You stop and feel your surroundings. Nothing is moving, not even the
    jet. \r\n\r\n\"We're at the bottom.\" You whisper. \r\n\nPress 1 to continue...\n\r\n"
