  storyText: "You continue reading. You're already sitting and your seatbelt is buckled.
    You always keep your seatbelt buckled unless you're getting up.\r\n\r\nYou feel
    the ride is starting to get bumpy but, you've been on hundreds of plane rides.
    You experienced this so much, they don't think anything of it.\r\n\r\nAll of a
    sudden the jet makes a hard turn left. You bang your head against the window.
    Through the pain you hear panicked voices coming from the cockpit. You try to
    stay calm but you know something is going wrong. \r\n\r\nYou want to prepare yourself
    for the worst. What do you do?\r\n1. Stay in your seat but run through scenarios
    in your head.\r\n2. Quickly get up and grab your survival bag from the storage
    above. "
