  storyText: "The jet lurches and shakes violently. You can hear the flight attendant
    crying from somewhere. You tense your body, grip onto the seat and glue the back
    of your head to the back of the seat to avoid whiplash. \r\n\r\nThe jet lands
    in the stormy water. You feel the metal of the jet groan, it sounded like a wing
    or something snapped off. But there is a sudden calm for a split second as the
    jet is floating in the water... for now. \r\n\nPress 1 to continue...\n"
