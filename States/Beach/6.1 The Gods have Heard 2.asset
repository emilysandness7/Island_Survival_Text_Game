  storyText: "There's a man... an unnaturally large and muscular man with long flowing
    hair, a robe on and a trident in his hand...  You notice he's standing on the
    water. \"P..Posidon...?\" You utter in disbelief. \r\n\r\nThe strange man laughed
    a manly laugh. \"Yes little mortal it is I! I have heard your plea and have come
    to rescue you!\"\r\n\r\nYou start stammering unintelligibly. What the hell is
    going on? Am I dreaming? Am I saved?!\r\n\r\nPoseidon offers out his hand. You

    You look down, a trident is sticking out of you.\r\n\nPress 1 to continue..."
